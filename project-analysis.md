## Problem
In Egypt and the wider Arab world, many people are eager to learn new skills in technology, design, and productivity, but they face several challenges:

1. **Overwhelming Resources** – There are thousands of courses, videos, and articles online, often scattered across different platforms, with no clear order or guidance. Beginners waste time searching instead of learning.  
2. **Lack of Structure** – Learners don’t know which skill to start with or the correct sequence of topics. This often leads to confusion, skipping important fundamentals, or giving up entirely.  
3. **No Skill Testing Before Learning** – Many invest hours or money into a field only to realize it’s not what they expected. They need a way to test their interest and suitability first.  
4. **Offline Learning Demand** – A large portion of Egyptian learners prefer classroom-based training or blended learning, but finding **reliable, local training centers** in their city is difficult.  
5. **No Unified Learning Guide in Arabic** – While global platforms exist, most are English-based and not tailored to Arab learners, especially Egyptians, making it harder for beginners to follow along.

## Solution

A **curated learning path platform** that works like a personal mentor, guiding users step-by-step through the best resources available online and offline — without creating original courses.  

**Core approach:**

- **Curation, not creation** – The platform finds the most effective existing resources (YouTube tutorials, articles, blogs, e-books, podcasts, online courses) and arranges them into clear **short** and **long** roadmaps for each field.
- **Two-track system** –  
  - *Short Track*: A quick introduction (5–10 hours total) so learners can test their interest and suitability.  
  - *Long Track*: A complete, structured journey from beginner to professional.
- **Personalized starting points** – Placement quizzes help learners skip what they already know and focus on new material.  
- **Reinforcement learning** – Practice quizzes and question banks help users test their understanding along the way.
- **Offline opportunities** – Database of Egyptian offline training centers by city and field, so learners can choose in-person options if they prefer.
- **Language accessibility** – Full Arabic (RTL) and English interface to cater to Egyptian learners and other Arabs.

By combining **clear structure**, **best-in-class resources**, and **both online and offline pathways**, the platform removes the guesswork and makes starting a new skill both easier and more motivating.
